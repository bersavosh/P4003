They simply need to be in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. If you are running the notebook on your own local setup, you need to download and put them in the same folder as the notebook.\n",

    "- Some questions may require you to define new python variables/functions and test your work by running cells over and over or add new cells for yourself to check/test. This is fine. Just make sure that after you have tested what you return is a clean notebook that runs smoothly and only has the output that is requested in each question.\n",
